# MICROPROCESSORS (381) IN CODE


## INTRODUCTION
> A microprocessor is a computer processor for which the data processing logic and control is included on a single integrated circuit (IC), or a small number of ICs. The microprocessor contains the arithmetic, logic, and control circuitry required to perform the functions of a computer's central processing unit (CPU). 

This repository contains the code-implementation of concepts taught in the COE 381 course by **DR. KEELSON** at the Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology
